	<h1>Swords and Spreadsheets</h1>
	<p>I've been really enjoying playing this game with my friends lately. It's a tabletop role-playing game where we get to pretend we're heroes from a primitive culture that has industrialized but hasn't yet achieved space flight. We spend hours exploring dungeons, fighting monsters, and strategizing about how to protect our tribe and grow our influence.</p>
	<p>Our gaming group is called "The Fellowship of the Spreadsheets," and we've been meeting every week for the past six months. It's been a great way for us to bond and unwind after a long day at work.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out the official website <a href="https://swordsandspreadsheets.com">here</a>.</p>
