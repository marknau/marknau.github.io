    <img src="drangel.jpg" alt="Picture of Wiz Drangel">
    <p>Wiz Drangel is one of my favorite fictional characters. They are a brilliant detective who travels to different planets to solve crimes and mysteries. I find their deductive reasoning and attention to detail to be truly inspiring.</p>
    <p>What sets Wiz Drangel apart from other detectives is their ability to adapt to different cultures and environments. Their open-mindedness and willingness to learn about new technologies and customs make them an effective problem-solver and a great example to follow.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite Wiz Drangel stories is "The Case of the Missing Moonstone," in which they solve the theft of a valuable gem on a planet where the inhabitants communicate through dance. Drangel's ability to understand their language and use it to solve the case is truly impressive.</p>
    <p>Overall, Wiz Drangel is a fascinating character who teaches us that with the right mindset, we can solve any problem and overcome any obstacle. I highly recommend these stories to anyone who enjoys a good mystery!</p>
